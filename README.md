# Description

This repository's main branch contains the latest version of ARM CMSIS and STMicroelectronics device header files. Embedded developers can use this repository to include CMSIS header files in your STM32 development projects.


## Core

Standardized API for the Cortex-M processor core and peripherals. Includes intrinsic functions for Cortex-M4/M7/M33/M35P SIMD instructions.

## Core_A

Standardized API and basic run-time system for the Cortex-A5/A7/A9 processor core and peripherals.

## Device

Silicone vendor specific header files (For example STM32F4xx, STM32F7xx, etc.)

## DSP

DSP library collection with over 60 functions for various data types: fixed-point (fractional q7, q15, q31) and single precision floating-point (32-bit). Implementations optimized for the SIMD instruction set are available for Cortex-M4/M7/M33/M35P.

## Include

Standard header include files for ARM Cortex Microconrollers.

## NN

Collection of efficient neural network kernels developed to maximize the performance and minimize the memory footprint on Cortex-M processor cores.

## RTOS (RTOS V1)

Common API for real-time operating systems along with a reference implementation based on RTX. It enables software components that can work across multiple RTOS systems.

## RTOS2 (RTOS V2)

Extends CMSIS-RTOS v1 with Armv8-M support, dynamic object creation, provisions for multi-core systems, binary compatible interface.
